# CS430Project4
In the previous project you will wrote code to raycast and shade mathematical primitives based
on a scene input file into a pixel buffer. In this project you will add recursive raytracing to
provide reflection and refraction.

Some black pixels will be scattered along the shapes, minor issue

Compile with:
gcc raytracer.c -o raytracer

Usage:
raytracer [width] [height] input.json output.ppm
